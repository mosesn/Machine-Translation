All of the homework data is in the code directory.  I included the input directory so that you can run the code properly.  The programs must be run from inside of the code directory, because all of the paths are hardcoded.

To run model 1, cd into the code directory, and run "python model1.py".

For model 1, the devwords and first 20 sentences data is in model1_output.txt.  It also has timing data.  It is unformatted, but correct.

To run model 2, cd into the code directory, and run "python model2.py".

For model 2, the first 20 sentences data is in model2_output.txt.  It also has timing data.  It is unformatted, but correct.
